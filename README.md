# LSTM_options_hedge


This is an illustration to  to use LSTM to predict future stock prices or market volatility, so that we can decide when to buy options (like call or put options) to hedge a portfolio. The key here is to optimize the timing of these option purchases to protect the portfolio from downside risk or to take advantage of expected market movements.


Step 1: Market Data as Time-Series
The key input to the LSTM model is historical market data, which will help in predicting future price movements. Typical data inputs include:
s_t = [stock_price, VIX, option_greeks, portfolio_value]
Where:
stock_price is the closing price of the stock at time t.
VIX is the volatility index at time t.
option_greeks (like delta, gamma, vega) represent the sensitivity of options to changes in underlying variables at time t.
portfolio_value represents the value of the portfolio at time t.
The goal is to predict future values of stock prices, volatility, or Greeks, which will inform the decision to hedge.


Step 2: Problem as a Time-Series Forecasting Task
The task of LSTM is to predict the future values of stock prices or volatility by learning from historical data. We define a lookback window of historical observations (e.g., the last 60 days) and use this window to make predictions for the next day.
Letâ€™s define:
X_t = [s_{t-60}, s_{t-59}, ..., s_{t-1}]
This is the input to the LSTM, representing the historical data over a 60-day period.
y_t = [stock_price_t]
This is the target output, representing the stock price we want to predict for time t.


Step 3: LSTM Structure
LSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is particularly good at handling sequences of data (like time-series) because they can capture both short-term and long-term dependencies in the data.

The LSTM operates as follows:

Forget Gate: The forget gate decides which information from the previous cell state (c_{t-1}) should be discarded. It is controlled by a sigmoid function:
f_t = sigmoid(W_f * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)
Where:
f_t is the forget gate vector.
W_f and b_f are the weights and biases of the forget gate.
h_{t-1} is the hidden state from the previous time step.
x_t is the input data at the current time step.

Input Gate: The input gate decides which new information should be stored in the cell state. It consists of two parts: the candidate cell state and the update gate.
i_t = sigmoid(W_i * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)
This equation controls which information is updated in the cell.
The candidate cell state is computed as:
c'_t = tanh(W_c * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_c)
Update Cell State: The new cell state c_t is a combination of the previous cell state and the candidate cell state:
c_t = f_t * c_{t-1} + i_t * c'_t

Output Gate: The output gate decides what the next hidden state h_t should be:
o_t = sigmoid(W_o * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)
The new hidden state is:
h_t = o_t * tanh(c_t)
The hidden state h_t is what will be used to make the prediction for the stock price or volatility.


Step 4: LSTM Training
Once the model architecture is defined, we train the LSTM to minimize the prediction error. This is done by defining a loss function that computes the difference between the predicted stock price \hat{y}_t and the actual stock price y_t.
The common loss function used is mean squared error (MSE):
L = (1/N) * sum((\hat{y}_t - y_t)^2 for t in training set)
Where:
\hat{y}_t is the predicted stock price for day t.
y_t is the actual stock price for day t.
N is the total number of training examples.
The model uses backpropagation through time (BPTT) to adjust the weights in the LSTM network to minimize the loss L.


Step 5: Prediction of Stock Price or Volatility
After the LSTM is trained, it can make predictions on new data. Given a recent 60-day history, the model predicts the stock price for the next day.
Let:
\hat{y}_t be the predicted stock price for day t.
\hat{y}_{t+1} be the predicted stock price for day t+1, and so on.


Step 6: Hedging Strategy Using the Predictions
Based on the predicted stock price, the strategy to hedge the portfolio using options can be determined as follows:
Rule-Based Hedging Strategy:
Buy Put Options if the model predicts that the stock price will fall significantly. This will hedge against a downside risk in the portfolio.
If the percentage change in the predicted stock price is less than a certain threshold (e.g., -5%), the agent will buy a put option.
pct_change = (predicted_price_{t+1} - predicted_price_t) / predicted_price_t
if pct_change < -0.05:
    action = "Buy Put Option"
Buy Call Options if the model predicts that the stock price will rise significantly. This will hedge against missing out on potential gains.
If the percentage change in the predicted stock price is more than a certain threshold (e.g., 5%), the agent will buy a call option.
if pct_change > 0.05:
    action = "Buy Call Option"
Hold (Do Nothing) if the predicted price movement is small or unclear.
If the percentage change is between -5% and 5%, no action is taken.
else:
    action = "Hold"

    
Step 7: Evaluating the Strategy
To evaluate whether the strategy is effective, we can look at the hedging performance:
Measure how much the portfolio is protected during downturns.
Evaluate the cost of buying the options (i.e., the premium paid).
Calculate the overall profit and loss (P&L) from the hedging strategy.
A metric like Sharpe Ratio can be used to evaluate risk-adjusted returns:
Sharpe_Ratio = (mean(portfolio_returns) - risk_free_rate) / std(portfolio_returns)
Where:
mean(portfolio_returns) is the average return on the hedged portfolio.
risk_free_rate is the rate of return on a risk-free asset.
std(portfolio_returns) is the standard deviation of the portfolio returns.
